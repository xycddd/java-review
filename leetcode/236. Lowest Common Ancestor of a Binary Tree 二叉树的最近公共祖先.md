Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.<br>

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”<br>

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]<br>
!(Alt text)(https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

Example 1:<br>
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```
Example 2:<br>
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Note:<br>

All of the nodes' values will be unique.<br>
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.<br>

```
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
       if (!root || p == root || q == root) return root;
       TreeNode *left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
       if (left && left != p && left != q) return left;//优化代码，可以省略
       TreeNode *right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p , q);
　　　　if (left && right) return root;
       return left ? left : right;
    }
};
