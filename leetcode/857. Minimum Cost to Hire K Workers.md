#### 题目：雇佣K个工人的最小花费

There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.

2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.



Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

 

**Example 1:**

Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
**Example 2:**

Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 
 

**Note:**

1. 1 <= K <= N <= 10000, where N = quality.length = wage.length

2. 1 <= quality[i] <= 10000

3. 1 <= wage[i] <= 10000

4. Answers within 10^-5 of the correct answer will be considered correct.

#### 算法解析
我果然还是一个菜鸟，本题参考了两位大佬的思路<a href="https://blog.csdn.net/ihsin/article/details/82771186"> l-Hsin</a> <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/11329482.html">Grandyoung</a>
考虑一种最简单的情况，假设$K=2$，有两个人$x,y$,
- 如果$\frac{wage[x]}{quality[x]} < \frac{wage[y]}{quality[y]}$，那么$y$的报酬为$wage[y]$，$x$的报酬一定大于$wage[x]$ 此时$x$的报酬等于$\frac{quality[x]*wage[y]}{quality[y]} > \frac{quality[x]*wage[x]}{quality[x]}=wage[x]$，所以将它们工人按照薪资和能力值的比例排序
-  如果确定薪资和能力的比值的最大值，那么第$x$个人的工资就是
$\frac{quality[x]}{quality[y]} = \frac{wage[x]}{wage[y]}$ 
$ wage[x]=\frac{wage[y]}{quality[y]} * quality[x]$

需要支付的工资总和为 $\sum^{n}_{i=0}{quality[i]} * \frac{wage[y]}{quality[y]} $
使用大顶堆存储quality[i]的值，如果个数超过K个，就将堆顶元素弹出，这样就可以保证和最小
```
class Solution {
public:
    double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int K) {
        double res=DBL_MAX,sum=0;
        vector<pair<double,int>> rates;
        for(int i=0;i<quality.size();i++){
            rates.push_back(make_pair((double)wage[i]/quality[i],i));
        }
        sort(rates.begin(),rates.end());
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        
        for(auto rate:rates){
            sum+=quality[rate.second];
            pq.push(quality[rate.second]);
            if(pq.size()>K){
                sum-=pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
            if(pq.size()==K){
                res=min(res,sum*rate.first);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
