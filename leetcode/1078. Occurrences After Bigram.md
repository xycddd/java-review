####题目：出现在两个词之后的词
Given words first and second, consider occurrences in some text of the form "first second third", where second comes immediately after first, and thirdcomes immediately after second.

For each such occurrence, add "third" to the answer, and return the answer.

 

**Example 1:**

Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
**Example 2:**

Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
 

**Note:**

1. 1 <= text.length <= 1000

2. text consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

3. 1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10

4. first and second consist of lowercase English letters.

####算法解析
非常简单的一道题，没什么可解释的
```
class Solution {
    public String[] findOcurrences(String text, String first, String second) {
        String[] arr = text.split(" ");
        List<String> res=new ArrayList<String>();
        for(int i=2;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i-2].equals(first) && arr[i-1].equals(second)){
                res.add(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        return res.toArray(new String[res.size()]);
    }
}
```
