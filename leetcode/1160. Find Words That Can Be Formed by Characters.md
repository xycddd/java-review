#### 题目：找到可以由字母组成的单词
You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

 

**Example 1:**

Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
**Example 2:**

Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
**Note:**

1. 1 <= words.length <= 1000

2. 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100

3. All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

#### 算法解析
计算一下字符串chars中每个字符的出现次数，然后遍历words中的每个单词，统计出每个单词中每个字符的出现次数，与chars中字符的次数进行比较
```
class Solution {
    public int countCharacters(String[] words, String chars) {
        int[] frequency = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length(); i++) {
            char c = chars.charAt(i);
            frequency[c - 'a']++;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (isExist(word, frequency)) {
                res += word.length();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    public boolean isExist(String word, int[] frequency) {
        int[] cnt = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            cnt[c - 'a']++;
            if (cnt[c - 'a'] > frequency[c - 'a']) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
