Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), <br>
where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h.<br>
Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.<br>

Note:<br>
The number of people is less than 1,100.<br>

 
Example:<br>

Input:<br>
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]<br>

Output:<br>
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]<br>
#### 算法解析
先按照身高排序，如果身高相同k比较小的排在前面
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(),people.end(),[](vector<int> a,vector<int> b){
            return a[0]>b[0] ||(a[0] == b[0] && a[1]<b[1]);
        });
        
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        for(auto a:people){
            res.insert(res.begin()+a[1],a);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
