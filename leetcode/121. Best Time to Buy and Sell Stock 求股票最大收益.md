#### 题目：求股票最大收益(只允许一次买卖)
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.<br>
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.<br>
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.<br>
**Example 1:**<br>
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] <br>
Output: 5 <br>
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.   Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.<br>
**Example 2:**<br>
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]<br> 
Output: 0 <br>
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.<br>
#### 算法解析
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int res=0,buy=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++){
            buy=min(buy,prices[i]);
            res=max(res,prices[i]-buy);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
